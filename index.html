<h1 class="first" style="font-variant: uppercase;">Laryngeal papillomatosis</h1>
<h3><marquee>Laryngeal papillomatosis is rare respiratory disease in which growths along the passages from the mouth and nose to the lungs develop and obstruct airflow. </marquee></h3>

<h3 class="third">CAUSES</h3>
<p>Laryngeal papillomatosis and the resultant laryngeal tumors are caused by two kinds of human papilloma virus, better known as the HPV virus. In most cases, people who are exposed to HPV do not experience any kind of illness, but there are over 150 different types of HPV, many that cause different kinds of illnesses with different symptoms. Many of them cause warts and tumors that are generally benign. They are also associated with cervical cancer in females.</p><p>

In the case of laryngeal papillomatosis, the infection is caused by the HPV 6 and HPV 11 viruses, which also commonly cause genital warts. There is still uncertainty about how the infection occurs and why it causes illness in some individuals. One source of infection that is established is that the infection can be passed on to a baby during natural childbirth. In adults, it has not yet been established if laryngeal papillomatosis is a sexually transmitted disease.</p><p>

Laryngeal papillomatosis can affect anyone irrespective of age or gender. Adults may be affected with the infection and it can also affect infants and children when they contract the virus at birth.</p>

	<h3 class="third">SYMPTOMS</h3>
<p>Patients suffering from a granuloma on the vocal cords generally experience:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Hoarseness of voice</li><li>
Breathing difficulty</li><li>
Chronic coughing
</li>


</ul>

<h3 class="third">DIAGNOSIS</h3>
<p>In some cases doctors may be able to make a diagnosis of laryngeal papillomatosis by simply using a mirror positioned in the patient’s mouth in a way that it reflects light on the vocal folds and the larynx. The most commonly used method of diagnosis, however, is an indirect laryngoscopy. To perform this procedure a flexible fiber optic camera is inserted through the patient’s nose and it gives the physician a clear view of the vocal folds. Alternatively, the physician may also use a straight, rigid camera, which would instead need to be positioned through the mouth.</p><p>

A direct larygoscopy may also be used for the diagnosis. A biopsy can also be obtained during the procedure and the lesion can be tested for HPV. This method of diagnosis is often recommended for children because of the minimum discomfort of the procedure due to the general anesthesia and high risk of complications that could result from a misdiagnosis.</p>

	<h3 class="third">TREATMENTS</h3>
<p>Laryngeal papillomatosis is not really curable, but the tumors and growths can be removed to eliminate the symptoms and prevent complications. Antiviral drugs may be prescribed but surgical treatment is the primary treatment. Conventional surgery is rapidly being replaced by laser surgery, as this minimizes the risk of scarring of the larynx tissue, which sometimes occurred in conventional surgery</p>
